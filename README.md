Items part of the project:
* Project1 Files (shared through Google Drive since the files are too large to be uploaded to GitHub) link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12evkihoAs7KIc9YuXa2b36S3_MNhAcgS?usp=drive_link 
  * shapefiles
  * FRED3.csv
  * FRED4.csv
* "MYang_TP.qmd" that renders to HTML
* "MYang_TP_report.qmd" that renders to PDF

The two QMDs do not contain the exact same information. The HTML file contains fewer descriptions compared to the PDF report, but it contains interactive graphs that don't render in the report.
